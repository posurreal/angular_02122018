1. Create a REST service endpoint for a collection of My Little Ponies. For each pony, store the following info:

https://mylittlepony.hasbro.com/en-us/parents/activities

Id
Name
Color
Superpower

2. Create a new module named Pony Tool.

3. Create a service which returns all ponies and one pony.

For the all ponies only return id and name. For the one pony return all fields.

4. Build a component which displays all ponies showing the id and name.

5. Build a component which displays all of the details for one pony.

6. Setup routing to allow viewing all of the ponies, then clicking a link to view one pony.

Hint: setup the routing in the app.routing.ts file.

So there should be a list route, and a view route.
